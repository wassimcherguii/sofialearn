design:
1. General Theme

Concept: Elegant, soft, and literary (evokes handwriting, notes, paper, and the charm of words).

Mood: Calm, friendly, and educational.

Tone: Encouraging and confident (“Pour un impact sans faute!” = “For a flawless impact!”).

🌈 2. Color Palette

Primary Color: Deep Green (#006F5F or similar) — used for titles and accent text (“LA PLUME”).

Secondary Color: Soft Red (#E03C31) — used for calls to action and highlights (“Pour un impact sans faute!”).

Backgrounds: Light beige / paper texture — evokes writing or note paper.

Accents: White and soft grey for readability.

✅ Use muted tones with good contrast for readability (and DYS-friendly, as written).

✏️ 3. Typography

Headline Font: Clean sans-serif with confidence and clarity (e.g., Montserrat, Poppins, Raleway).

Body Font: Friendly rounded sans-serif (e.g., Nunito, Open Sans).

Style: Mix bold text (for motivational slogans) and light text (for friendly explanations).

🪶 4. Graphic Elements

Paper Texture → Background or card surfaces should resemble notepaper or stationery.

Feather Icon → Represents writing, used as a recurring motif.

Logo Element (Chili or Pen Tip) → Rounded icon in circle, top-left.

Torn Paper / Sticky Note Style → For highlighting messages or lessons.

💬 5. Language & Pedagogical Tone

Friendly learning vibe: short, mini-lessons (“nos mini leçons”).

Encouragement and progress focus: “Progressez en français.”

DYS-friendly means: readability, spacing, soft contrasts, and calm layout (avoid dense blocks).

🧩 6. Layout & Composition

Center-aligned hierarchy:

Logo → Title → Slogan → Call to action → Footer tag.

Use vertical flow with generous spacing (like a poster).

Combine flat UI components with paper/organic textures.

🪄 7. Key Design Keywords for Flowbite Adaptation

To recreate this style with Flowbite + Tailwind, focus on:

Theme Aspect	Flowbite / Tailwind Implementation
Colors	text-emerald-800, text-red-500, bg-amber-50, bg-neutral-50
Shapes	Rounded corners (rounded-2xl), soft shadows (shadow-md shadow-emerald-100)
Typography	font-sans font-semibold tracking-wide for headers
Texture	Use subtle paper background image (bg-[url('/images/paper-texture.png')] bg-cover)
Icons	Feather icon (Lucide-React or Heroicons) for branding consistency
Accessibility	Adequate contrast + large line height for DYS friendliness
